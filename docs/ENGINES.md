# Pricing-engine seam

The platform runs fully without a pricing engine. When one is configured,
agents gain **model fair prices** for whole boards — with Monte Carlo error
bars — which powers the `model_value` watch, the consistency-edge scan, and
engine-priced predictions for backtest/CLV.

## Configuration

| Env var | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SPORTSDATA_AGENTS_ENGINE_BACKEND` | `none` (default) / `local` / `remote` | Which backend `quant.engines.resolve_engine()` returns |
| `SPORTSDATA_AGENTS_ENGINE_API_URL` | URL | Hosted pricing API (remote backend) |
| `SPORTSDATA_AGENTS_ENGINE_API_KEY` | secret | Bearer key for the hosted API |

`local` lazily imports an engines package if one is installed in the
environment — this repo never depends on it and degrades cleanly without it.
`remote` is a thin key-authenticated client; until the hosted service is
live it reports unavailable rather than erroring.

## Surfaces

- **`engine_fair_prices` tool** (quant tools): price a fixture's board.
  Quote payloads mirror what any book quotes — racing
  `{win_odds: {runner: odds}}`, footy
  `{h2h: [home, away], total: [line, over, under]}`. With `record: true`
  the prices are stored as predictions under an auto-managed
  `engine:<sport>` model artifact, so the existing value watch, backtest
  and CLV replay them unchanged.
- **`model_value` watch kind**: seeds the engine from a book's own anchors,
  prices the board, and fires where that book's derivative quotes sit
  outside the model's noise band. Params: `sport` (engine sport),
  `price_sport` (warehouse label if different), `book`, `min_edge_pct`
  (default 3), `error_multiple` (default 3 standard errors),
  `max_age_minutes` (default 30 — stale quotes never meet fresh prices),
  `places` (racing). Skips cleanly when no engine is configured.
- **`quant.engine_value.consistency_scan`**: the pure maths — join book
  quotes to engine prices on (market, selection, line), require the edge to
  clear the threshold AND the error band.
- **Advisory tools** (no engine needed): `cash_out_estimate`,
  `slip_redundancy`, `value_board` (edge × confidence × freshness ranking
  with correlated-exposure annotation). Advisory only — the platform never
  places bets.

## Coverage note

The derivative comparison joins on exact (market, selection, line) keys, so
its breadth is the **intersection** of the engine's board ladder and the
book's quoted ladder (an engine board prices ~5 lines per family around its
simulated mean; books quote many more). Full-board family expansion widens
this in a later milestone; the join never fabricates a price for a line the
engine didn't compute.

## Noise discipline

Engine prices carry `std_error`. Every consumer here treats differences
inside the error band as noise: the scan skips them, the board's confidence
term discounts them, and unknown error bars score 0.5 confidence — unknown
certainty is not full certainty. A "value" candidate can still be a model
bias rather than an edge (e.g. structured tail misses show up as apparent
alternate-total value); replay measurement, not a single scan, decides what
is real.
